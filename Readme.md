</div>

<p align="center" style="max-width:600px; margin: 0 auto;">An add-in for Autodesk Fusion 360 that automates the creation of heat-set insert holes for 3D printing, using insert dimension recommendations from <a href="https://cnckitchen.com">CNC Kitchen</a>.</p>

## Features

-  **Pre-configured insert sizes** - CNC Kitchen’s recommended dimensions for common sizes (M2, M2.5, M3, M4, M5, M6, M8, M10, and 1/4"-20 camera thread)
-  **Blind holes and through holes** - Automatically calculates correct depths
- Automatic **top chamfer** (0.5 mm × 45°; fully customizable)
- Automatic **bottom fillet** (0.5 mm radius; fully customizable)
-  **Multiple holes at once** - Select multiple sketch points to create several holes in one operation
-  **Timeline grouping** - All operations grouped with descriptive names for easy management
-  **Direct integration** - Holes are cut directly into your part, no manual combine operations needed
-  **User-friendly interface** - Button in SOLID > MODIFY menu with intuitive dialog

## Why ThreadMeister?

Tired of googling insert dimensions every time you need a bore for a heat-set insert? ThreadMeister has them built in — just pick your size and it creates the hole directly in your model. No more manual circle sketching, no more wrong depths, no more manual extrude cuts.

## Platform Support

- **Windows**: Fully tested  
- **macOS**: Expected to work; not yet fully verified due to lack of hardware  
  - Code uses cross‑platform paths (`os.path.join`)  
  - No Windows‑specific APIs  
  - Icon loading and geometry creation should behave identically  


## Installation

### Method 1: Manual Installation

1. Download this repository (Code → Download ZIP)
2. Extract the `ThreadMeister` folder
3. Copy the folder to your Fusion 360 Add-Ins directory:
   - **Windows**: `C:\Users\[YourUsername]\AppData\Roaming\Autodesk\Autodesk Fusion 360\API\AddIns\`
   - **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Autodesk/Autodesk Fusion 360/API/AddIns/`
4. Restart Fusion 360
5. Go to **Utilities** → **Add-Ins** → **Scripts and Add-Ins** → **Add-Ins** tab
6. Find `ThreadMeister` and click **Run**
7. Optional: Check **Run on Startup** to load automatically

### Autodesk App Store Installation
ThreadMeister is also available on the Autodesk App Store (pending approval).  
The App Store version installs automatically and updates cleanly.


### Method 2: Git Clone

```bash
cd "C:\Users\[YourUsername]\AppData\Roaming\Autodesk\Autodesk Fusion 360\API\AddIns\"
git clone git clone https://github.com/AndreasOKircher/ThreadMeister.git ThreadMeister
```

## Usage

### Quick Start

1. **Create a sketch** and place **sketch points** or use existing line/arc endpoints where insert holes should be created.  
2. **Finish the sketch**  
3. Click the **"ThreadMeister"** button in **SOLID → MODIFY** menu
4. **Select your target body** (the part to add holes to)
5. **Select one or more sketch points**  
6. Choose your **insert size** (e.g., M3 x 5.7mm standard)
7. Choose **Blind Hole** or **Through Hole**
8. Enable/disable top **chamfer** and bottom **fillet** (recommended: enabled)
9. Click **OK**

### Insert Specifications

All dimensions follow CNC Kitchen's official recommendations:

| Insert Size | Hole Diameter | Insert Length | Min Wall Thickness |
|------------|---------------|---------------|-------------------|
| M2 x 3mm | 3.2mm | 3.0mm | 1.5mm |
| M2.5 x 4mm | 4.0mm | 4.0mm | 1.5mm |
| M3 x 3mm (short) | 4.4mm | 3.0mm | 1.6mm |
| M3 x 4mm (short) | 4.4mm | 4.0mm | 1.6mm |
| M3 x 5.7mm (standard) | 4.4mm | 5.7mm | 1.6mm |
| M4 x 4mm (short) | 5.6mm | 4.0mm | 2.0mm |
| M4 x 8.1mm (standard) | 5.6mm | 8.1mm | 2.0mm |
| M5 x 5.8mm (short) | 6.4mm | 5.8mm | 2.5mm |
| M5 x 9.5mm (standard) | 6.4mm | 9.5mm | 2.5mm |
| M6 x 12.7mm | 8.0mm | 12.7mm | 3.0mm |
| M8 x 12.7mm | 9.7mm | 12.7mm | 4.0mm |
| M10 x 12.7mm | 12.0mm | 12.7mm | 5.0mm |
| 1/4"-20 x 12.7mm | 8.0mm | 12.7mm | 3.0mm |

**Note:** For blind holes, the total extrude depth = insert length + extra depth + chamfer (if enabled). For example, with an M3 x 5.7 mm insert and default settings: 5.7 + 1.0 extra + 0.5 chamfer = 7.2 mm. The chamfer is added to the extrude length because it cuts into the top of the bore and would otherwise reduce usable depth for the insert.

### Customize settings

Edit `config.ini` to adjust behavior. The file is located in the add-in folder. The config is organized into four sections:

**`[Settings]`** — Design parameters

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `chamfer_size` | 0.5 | Top chamfer size in mm (45° chamfer). The chamfer cuts into the top of the bore, reducing usable depth for the insert. |
| `blind_hole_extra_depth` | 1.0 | Extra depth added to blind holes in mm. Compensates for chamfer depth and provides clearance below the insert. |
| `bottom_radius_size` | 0.5 | Bottom fillet radius in mm (blind holes only) |

**`[Inserts]`** — Insert specifications

Each line defines an insert: `name = hole_diameter_mm, insert_length_mm, min_wall_thickness_mm`

You can add custom inserts by adding a new line, e.g.:
```ini
M3 x 6mm (custom) = 4.6, 6.0, 1.8
```

**`[UI State]`** — Remembered menu state (saved automatically between sessions)

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `chamfer_enabled_default` | True | Chamfer checkbox state |
| `bottom_radius_enabled_default` | False | Bottom fillet checkbox state |
| `show_success_message` | True | Show confirmation dialog after operation |
| `hole_type_blind` | True | Hole type: `True` = Blind, `False` = Through |
| `last_selected_insert` | M3 x 5.7mm (standard) | Last selected insert size |

**`[Developer]`** — Debug options (for development and support)

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `enable_logging` | False | Write debug messages to Fusion's Text Commands palette |
| `enable_debug_export` | False | Show "Export Debug JSON" checkbox in the dialog |

## Requirements

- Autodesk Fusion 360
- Python support (built into Fusion 360)
- Windows or macOS

## Tips

- **Print orientation matters**: Test hole sizes for your specific printer and orientation
- **Wall thickness**: Always ensure adequate wall thickness around holes
- **Multiple holes**: Select multiple points to create several holes efficiently
- **Timeline**: All operations are grouped - you can easily undo or suppress the entire set

## Troubleshooting

**Button doesn't appear:**
- Make sure the add-in is in the AddIns folder (not Scripts folder)
- Restart Fusion 360
- Check that the add-in is running in the Add-Ins tab

**Inserts or holes are the wrong size:**
- Add your own insert specifications to the config file (or change existing definitions)

**Chamfer or fillet radius missing:**
- The chamfer and fillet radius can be selected in the config menu

## Known Technical Limitations

### Through‑hole extrusion instability
Fusion 360 may fail to create through‑hole extrusions in certain situations. This typically occurs when the sketch or target body contains complex or ambiguous geometry that prevents Fusion from resolving a clean cut.

Symptoms include:
- Missing through‑hole cut  
- Partial cut that stops before exiting the body  
- “Profile not found” or “Operation failed” errors  

Common causes:
- Complex or thin‑walled bodies  
- Ambiguous extrusion direction  
- Overlapping or poorly defined profiles  

Workarounds:
- Simplify the geometry around the bore location  
- Ensure the target body has clean, manifold geometry  
- Move the bore point into a separate sketch  

---

### Sketch profile overload (resolved in v1.2.0)
In earlier versions, ThreadMeister drew the bore circle in the user's existing sketch. If that sketch had many intersecting lines or Fusion's auto-projected body edges near the bore location, profile selection could fail.

Since v1.2.0, ThreadMeister creates a clean temporary sketch containing only the bore circle, eliminating this issue entirely.
