# ThreadMeister Extended Development Memory

## Phase Status
- ✅ Phase 1: Core geometry functions
- ✅ Phase 2: Pytest test suite (49 tests passing)
- ✅ Phase 3: Debug export & visualization infrastructure
- ✅ **Phase 4: Test fixes - ALL 16 TESTS PASSING**

## Recent Fixes
- [Test Fixes Completed](test_fixes_completed.md) - Resolved blocking mock iteration issue

## Known Issues - RESOLVED

- ✅ Profile accuracy level mismatch - FIXED
- ✅ MagicMock attribute auto-generation interfering with ObjectCollection detection - FIXED

## How to Run Tests
```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_profile_selection.py -v
```

### Debug Mode (Enable Algorithm Logging)
Edit `tests/conftest.py` line 46:
```python
tm_state.CONFIG['enable_logging'] = True  # Set to True to see algorithm debug output
```

Then run tests to see filter details, distances, and accumulation search progress.

## Next Steps
- Integrate real Fusion 360 fixture data as it's exported
- Continue with Phase 4+ feature development
